# MiniSQL
It is the project for the Database Design course at ZJU. It is a mini database system like MySQL, but it's built by ourselves.

It implemented the following notion in Database Design:
- Buffer Manager (Cache, with clock replacement algorithms)
- Record Manager (Organization of records in a table)
- Index Manager (B+ tree)
- Catalog Manager (Maintain catalog information)
- Interpreter
